# simpleMLapp
A Simple ML application that predicts Academic Performance based on IQ, EQ, and AQ. Not trained on real data. This is only for demonstration purposes of the data application. May this simple application springboard your journey on creating data applications for machine learning purposes using R shiny. This repository includes the following documents:
1. R application which holds the r codes for the app. It integrates both the UI and the Server codes.
2. The sample csv file which contains the hypothetical data.
3. The Linear model stored as a .rds file that will be used for predicting academic performance.

R shiny applications only work efficiently on ML models trained using R. It can be done with Python trained models but will be inefficient to have them on shiny server.
